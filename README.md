# 👨🏻‍💻Customer Behavior Data Analyst Portfolio Project
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, starting from raw data ingestion to actionable business insights. The objective is to analyze the dataset using Python and SQL, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data cleaning, and present insights through an interactive Power BI dashboard, a detailed report, and a presentation created using Gamma.

The project highlights practical skills in data processing, analysis, visualization, and reporting—similar to real-world analytics tasks.

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to simulate a corporate-grade end-to-end data analytics workflow, demonstrating the ability to translate raw data into strategic business intelligence by:

✅ Data Preparation,Modeling & Exploratory Data Analysis (Python): Clean and transform the raw dataset for analysis.

✅ Data Analysis (SQL): Simulate business transactions, and run queries to extract insights on customer segments, loyalty, and purchase drivers.

✅ Visualization & Insights (Power BI): Build an interactive dashboard that highlights key patterns and trends, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions.

✅ Report and Presentation: Write a clear project report summarizing your key findings and business recommendations. Prepare a presentation that visually communicates insights and actionable recommendations to stakeholders.
